// Pre-Generative ART by Yedeg

// How to use it?

Just look at the config & script.js, the ones marked with "#" are the ones you should edit
The rest shouldn't be touched unless you are familiar with code.

// 

Add a "files" folder inside of "Pre-generative art" folder

and add basic asset names for your NFT "backgrounds, head, eyes, mouth wear, etc"


// Support?

Just lmk on guilded.gg or tele

guilded = H3nry.3DS

tele = @ususlol
